        <h2>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h2>
          <p>
            <ul>
              <li>Neuroplasticity - I can learn new and complex information. My mind is not stuck the way it is.</li>
              <li>I enjoy problem solving but can get frustrated when things dont go as planned. </li>
              <li>I need to incorporate mindfulness through out the day to ensure I dont get overwhelmed.</li>
          </ul></p>

        <h2>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h2>
           <p> These qualities are important as you need empathy and self self-awareness towards yourself and others. We need to practice kindness towards ourselves so we can be kind to others. These values are important to me as a person and I feel I will grow with these values during my programming journey. </p>

        <h2>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h2>
            <p>How important human skills are in programming. Where else I though your technical skills are the most valued in your career.</p>

        <h2>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on my learning journey. I have never actively reflected like this before. </p>

        <h2>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h2>
            <p>So we can learn to be kind and patient with ourselves and with each other. I think in work places, having well developed human skills is just as important as being technically proficient.</p>

        <h2>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practice programming instead? Justify your answer.</h2>

            <p>No, I think its important to keep  human skills in focus.</p>
