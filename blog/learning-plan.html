      <h1>My Learning plan</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>My long-term goal is to work in the tech industry while utilising my other technical skills, such as data analysis and research. In addition, I would like to work in an environmentally focussed company that prioterises improving our natural environment. Finally, I would also like to have my own start up one day that reflects my values.
        </li>
        <li>My strength in learning is to break problems down into smaller chunks and work through them. However, I can sometimes lack motivation to get the ball rolling, which is a limiting factor in my learning.</li>
          <li>I would like to develop my public speaking/presenting skills and improve my logical thinking skills.</li>
<li>I will manage my workload by keeping myself organised and accountable and asking for help when it feels overwhelming.</li>
      <li>I expect the facilitation team to provide technical and well-being support.</li>

</ul>
