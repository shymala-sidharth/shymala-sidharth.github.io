      <h1>Basics of Javascript</h1> 
      <h2>What is the relationship between JS, HTML, and CSS</h2>
      <p>I like to describe the relationship between them as, HTML is the builder that makes the basic structure of the house. CSS as the artist that paints and designs the house. Javascript as the magical wizard that can add functionality to the house. </p>
      <h2>Control Flow & Loops</h2>
         <p>The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script. Code is run in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the (extremely frequent) structures that change the control flow, such as conditionals and loops.</p>
         <p>A loop is a programming tool that is used to repeat a set of instructions. Iterate is a generic term that means “to repeat” in the context of loops. A loop will continue to iterate until a specified condition, commonly known as a stopping condition, is met.</p>
         <p>For example, we operate loops in real life for repetitive tasks. After grocery shopping we put away each item in our shopping bag until there are no items left.</p>
         <h2>The DOM</h2>
         <p>The DOM or Document Object Model, is a structural model of a web page that allows for JS to access that page. The system of organization in the DOM mimics the nesting structure of an HTML document. </p>

         <p> Elements nested within another are referred to as the children of that element. The element they are nested within is called the parent element of those elements. The DOM also allows access to the attributes of an HTML element such as style, id, etc.
         With this understanding, you can begin to leverage the power of scripting languages to create, update, and maintain web pages.</p>
      <h2>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h2>
         <p> Objects are mainly used to represent something that is made up of a set of characteristics. The characteristics are called properties and consist of a key and a value. We use the keys to access the information in our objects with either dot or bracket notation.
          Dot notation is mainly used, but bracket notation can be handy if we want to include spaces or start with numbers, as bracket notation only requires property identifiers to be a string. Arrays are used whenever we want to create and store a list of multiple items in one variable.
          Arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first item in an array has an index of zero. We use the position of items in the array to access the data. </p> 
          <h2>Functions</h2>
          <p>Function is a block of code that is designed to perform a particular task. They need to be called to be executed. Functions are useful because instead of having to type out the same code multiple times, functions allow you to store a bit of code that does a single task in a defined block and call it whenever you need with just a short command.</p>
