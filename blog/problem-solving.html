      <h1>Problem Solving</h1> 

      <h2>Time that I was blocked on a simple problem</h2>

          <p>The problem was to add new elements to an array of object. I knew there is an easy way of doing it but it took a really long to get it to work.
        I tried my best to look at all the course resources and look at the documentation but I was still blocked. I finally found a stackoverflow page that discussed the same problem as mine (kind of) and it worked.
        how did you feel throughout the process?
        I learnt that problem solving is not a linear process and can take time and readjusting and rethinking several aspects of your code to get it to do what you want.</p>

        <h2>Time that I elegantly solved a problem</h2>

          <p>To be honest, this has not happened for me yet. I still find myself referring to the documentation and other materials for guidance to solve my problem. Because my brain hasn't fully grasped computer logic yet, I feel like I am fumbling though it. I know this is a process though and will happen more elegantly over time.</p>

        <h2>Problem Solving Techniques/Processes</h2>
        
          <p>Pseudocode: For me this is a hard one to do. I see the benefits in it. However, I get trigger happy when I see a problem and start hacking my way through it. This is something I want to implement more. Especially in more complex problems. </p>

          <p>Trying something: Very confident. I like giving it a go and see where it takes me.</p>

          <p>Rubber Ducky Method: I kinda do this with my partner. I explain the problem to him and while doing so, I feel I see things better just by explaining the issue.</p>
          
          <p>Reading the error message: Very helpful and I feel like I am getting better and reading it. </p>

          <p>Console.log: I need to implement this more.</p>

          <p>Googling: I use this a lot. I feel I am getting better at sifting through all the information to find what I need.</p>

          <p>Asking Peers: I need to implement this more. </p>

          <p>Asking Coaches: I need to implement this more.</p>

          <p>Reflections: I need to do this more. Especially to retain the information.</p>
