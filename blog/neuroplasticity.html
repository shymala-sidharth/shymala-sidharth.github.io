      <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>

      <h2>How Neuroplasticity benefits us</h2>

      <p>Neuroplasticity is a scientific concept that out brains are capable of learning new information and that intelligence is not rigid. Meaning, that anyone is capable of learning new skills and intelligence is not fixed at birth. It benefits us to know this as it empowers people to continue learning and not hold on to limiting self beliefs. </p>

      <p>I want to use the principles of neuroplasticity to assure myself that I am capable to learning new and challenging things. I have also enjoyed learning but have fallen into the self limiting trap of 'Oh, this is not for me.... I am not smart enough.... I could never be as good as someone that has been doing this for years'. Now I know these beliefs are scientifically incorrect and through learning and reviewing, I can learn anything.</p>

    <h2>Ways to increase neuroplasticity:</h2>
      <ul>
         <li>Learning new languages(I will count Javascript as one) </li>
         <li>Travel</li>
         <li>Exercise</li>
         <li>Mindfulness</li>
      </ul>

     <h1> Growth Mindset</h1>

     <p>Growth mindset is a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People who have a growth mindset believe that even if they struggle with certain skills, their abilities aren't set in stone. They think that with work, their skills can improve over time.</p>
     <p>Learning about growth mindset made me realized that even when I struggle and am faced with obstacles, I know I can worth and learn from the experience which will help me develop new skills that will make me better at handling situations.</p>
     
     <p>I will integrate this in my learning journey and now give up when I fail or am faced with new obstacles, but to keep going and learning from the experience.</p>
