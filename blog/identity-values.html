      <h1>Identity, Values, and Strengths</h1>
      <ul>
     <li>I made an ethical decision to live a more sustainable and plant-based lifestyle. 
      I ensure to buy second-hand or thrifted clothing, furniture and other goods when possible to reduce my carbon footprint. 
      When going plant-based seven years ago, this decision negatively impacted my family as they had other cultural beliefs
       that did not agree with my decision. 
      Over time, however, they, too, see the positives in my decision and opt for more vegan options.</li>
      <li>I grew up in a conservative immigrant family where I felt decisions about my life were out of my control. 
        Growing up in Auckland, I saw the freedom my peers had and I longed for the same. 
        My hair, clothing and mannerism were all strongly controlled by my parents. 
        As I grew up and learnt more about the world, the more I pushed back to gain my independence. 
        Although I like some values of my culture, such as the festivities and stories, there is a lot I don't identify with.
        I feel I live in a hybrid state where I value critical thinking, questioning traditions, and making my own choices based on that.</li>
        <li>My strength is perseverance. 
          I know from my academic studies and work experience that I will see things through to the end.</li>
          <li>I can get overwhelmed when there is a lot to be done, and its just a matter of starting that can be hard. </li>
          <li>When working on a complex compliance case at Auckland Council, I received hostility from the consent holder.
            I received legal threats to stop me from pursuing the case and verbal abuse from the consent holder. 
            To understand the root of the hostility, I organised a meeting with the consent holder to discuss the situation. 
            During the meeting, she explained she received large invoices from the Council and had been treated poorly by other Council staff. 
            As a small business owner, she felt her lively hood was under threat and wanted to ensure that did not happen. 
            I understood her concerns and explained calmly how the consenting and compliance process works.
             I took the time to explain each consent condition and discussed what she needed to do to be compliant. 
             She later thanked me and said no one had taken the time to explain this to her, and now she fully understood her legal obligation. 
            I believe that effective communication and empathy can go a long way in resolving tense situations with people.
